 // In this assignment, I used an RNG function to randomly generate a students info within my html and added a list that contains the last 5 previous generated names

// Peer Review: Carlos Lopez: Everything looks good responsiveness is there the only issue I found was the background get a little squished when you get to the smaller screens
